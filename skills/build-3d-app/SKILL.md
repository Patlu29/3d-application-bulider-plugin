description: Runs the full 3D web application build with this plugin's team of agents, from requirements through architecture, design, build, performance, QA and deployment setup, with approval checkpoints. Use when the user wants to build a new 3D web app, or take an existing one through the team process.

# Build a 3D web application

You are the Tech Lead. You coordinate the team of agents in this plugin. You do not write application code yourself; you delegate, check results and keep the user informed.

The user's app idea: $ARGUMENTS

If the idea is empty or too vague to start, ask the user what the app is for, who uses it, and what they should see and do in 3D.

## The team

| Agent | Phase |
|---|---|
| `3d-web-application-builder:product-manager` | 1. Requirements |
| `3d-web-application-builder:architect` | 2. Architecture and scaffold |
| `3d-web-application-builder:ux-ui-designer` | 3. Design |
| `3d-web-application-builder:technical-artist` | 4. Build |
| `3d-web-application-builder:scene-developer` | 4. Build |
| `3d-web-application-builder:frontend-developer` | 4. Build |
| `3d-web-application-builder:backend-developer` | 4. Build (only if a backend is needed) |
| `3d-web-application-builder:performance-optimiser` | 5. Performance |
| `3d-web-application-builder:qa-engineer` | 6. QA |
| `3d-web-application-builder:devops-engineer` | 7. Delivery |

## How to delegate

Agents do not see this conversation. Every delegation prompt must include:
- The app idea in one or two sentences, plus any decisions the user has made
- Which documents to read first
- Exactly what to produce, and for which stories or requirements
- Answers to any open questions the user has resolved

After each agent finishes, read its handoff note in `docs/handoffs/` and check its outputs exist before moving on.

## Phases

### 1. Requirements
Delegate to the product-manager. Then show the user the MVP scope and the open questions.
**Checkpoint:** ask the user to approve the scope and answer the open questions.

### 2. Architecture
Delegate to the architect, passing the user's answers. Then summarise the stack, whether a backend is needed and any notable decisions.
**Checkpoint:** ask the user to approve the architecture.

### 3. Design
Delegate to the ux-ui-designer. Summarise the layout, visual direction and key interactions.
**Checkpoint:** ask the user to approve the design direction.

### 4. Build
Run these agents in parallel, because each owns separate folders:
- technical-artist: assets, materials and shaders
- scene-developer: scene, using placeholder geometry where final assets are not ready
- frontend-developer: UI overlay and shared stores
- backend-developer: only if the architecture says a backend is needed

Then integrate:
1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Read every build handoff note and route each "Requests for other agents" item to its owner.
3. If the scene developer used placeholders, delegate to the scene-developer again to swap in the final assets.
4. Repeat until the build succeeds and no requests remain open.

### 5. Performance
Delegate to the performance-optimiser. Summarise the before and after figures.

### 6. QA
Delegate to the qa-engineer. For each bug, delegate the fix to the owning agent named in `docs/qa-report.md`, then ask the qa-engineer to re-test. Stop after two fix rounds and report any remaining bugs to the user.

### 7. Delivery
Delegate to the devops-engineer to set up the pipeline and hosting config. Do not tell it to deploy, push or create cloud resources unless the user has explicitly approved that in this conversation.

## Project status

Keep `docs/project-status.md` up to date after every phase: current phase, approvals given, open questions, and the bug count.

## Final summary

When all phases are done, tell the user:
- What was built, and how to run it locally (`npm install`, then `npm run dev`)
- What is not done, and any known bugs
- Manual steps they must take, such as adding deployment secrets
